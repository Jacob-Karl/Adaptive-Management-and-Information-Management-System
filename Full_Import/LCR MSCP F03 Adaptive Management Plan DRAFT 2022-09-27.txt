Project Summary
Project F03 monitors the pre- and post-development presence of two covered rodent species, the Colorado River cotton rat (Sigmodon arizonae plenus, CRCR) and Yuma hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus eremicus, YHCR), and one evaluation rodent species, the sobrinus subspecies of the desert pocket mouse (Chaetodipus penicillatus sobrinus, DPMO) in LCR MSCP conservation areas with suitable habitat in Reaches 3-7. The conservation areas monitored to date include the Big Bend Conservation area (BBCA), Beal Lake Conservation Area (BLCA), Cibola National Wildlife Refuge Unit #1 Conservation Area (Cibola NWR Unit #1), Cibola Valley Conservation Area (CVCA), Hart Mine Marsh (HMM), Palo Verde Ecological Reserve (PVER), Hunter’s Hole, Laguna Division Conservation Area (LDCA), and Yuma East Wetland (YEW). The project began in FY2005 and will continue to FY2055. The ultimate goals for the two covered rodent species are to create and maintain 125 acres of habitat for CRCR and 76 acres of habitat for YHCR. The project supports adaptive management of habitat at the monitored conservation areas under Conservation Measures CRCR1 (status/habitat surveys – define habitat first 5 years), DPMO1 (locate occupied habitat and restore disturbed habitat), MRM1 (define habitat characteristics: DPMO), MRM2 (monitor and adaptively manage created habitat: CRCR, DPMO, and YHCR), and YHCR1 (status/habitat surveys – define habitat first 5 years). The ranges of the two covered species within the LCR MSCP planning area do not overlap; consequently, the LCR MSCP goals for these two require monitoring and habitat management at non-overlapping sets of conservation areas. Conservation areas targeted for habitat management for CRCR consist of: E01, BLCA; E04, PVER; E05, CVCA; E09, HMM; E21, Planet Ranch; E24, Cibola NWR Unit #1; E36, Parker Dam Camp; and E38, Three Fingers Lake. Those targeted for habitat management for YHCR consist of: E27, LDCA; E28, YEW; and E31, Hunters Hole. Monitoring and habitat management for DPMO take place incidentally to monitoring and habitat management for the two covered rodent species. The adaptive management cycle for Project F03 consists of reviewing results and methods from the previous year, reviewing the results of related monitoring and conservation efforts by other institutions, planning for the current year including monitoring design (where and when), data collection and quality assurance, statistical analysis, and reporting of results.
Project Background
The LCR MSCP Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) (LCR MSCP 2004a) initially identified three rodents as covered species for the program: the Colorado River cotton rat (Sigmodon arizonae plenus, CRCR), Yuma hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus eremicus, YHCR), and the sobrinus subspecies of the desert pocket mouse (Chaetodipus penicillatus sobrinus, DPMO). Subsequently, the program reclassified DPMO as an evaluation species (LCR MSCP 2007a). The three species have largely non-overlapping distributions. The two rat species occupy similar habitats of riparian vegetation with a “… dense understory of grasses and/or shrubs alongside or beneath an overhead cover of forbs and low-growing woody species” (Hill and Smith 2021); CRCR prefers such habitat around marshes, while YHCR prefers such habitat under a cottonwood-willow overstory. Historically these types of habitat in the LCR valley occurred naturally around the edges of wetlands and open water (Ohmart et al. 1988, LCR MSCP 2004b, 2016) but today also can occur in areas of created, irrigated riparian vegetation, along the edges of irrigated agricultural fields, and alongside water conveyances (Johnson and Unnasch 2015a, 2015b). The two species also have different geographic ranges, with CRCR limited to Reaches 3-4 and YHCR limited to Reaches 6-7 (e.g., Hill and Smith 2021). The pocket mouse subspecies, in turn, is thought to occur only in Reaches 1-2, where it occupies dry sandy washes with scattered large shrubs or trees, particularly creosote bush and/or mesquite; feeds on seeds from the shrubs and surrounding grasses and forbs; and relies on the shrubs for cover (LCR MSCP 2016, Johnson and Unnasch 2021). Other subspecies of desert pocket mouse, sometimes only distinguishable through genetic testing, occur elsewhere along the LCR valley (e.g., Hill and Smith 2021).
The LCR MSCP initiated Project F03 (originally titled “Small Mammal Colonization of Restoration Sites”) in FY2005 to begin filling in key gaps in knowledge of the distributions of the three species in the LCR valley (LCR MSCP 2005). The LCR MSCP then identified several scientific questions it needed to address to help it manage the three species and their habitat (LCR MSCP 2007a), initiated system-wide monitoring for the three species under Project D10 in FY2006 (LCR MSCP 2006), and began a three-year research study of the habitat requirements for the three species under Project C27 in FY2007 (LCR MSCP 2007b). The program revised its list of scientific questions concerning the three species in two subsequent strategic plans (LCR MSCP 2012, 2018), and closed Project D10 in FY2020 (LCR MSCP 2020). The LCR MSCP closely coordinated the three projects focused on the three rodent species—Projects C27, D10, and F03—and their collective experiences and findings comprise the base of knowledge for the continuing efforts of Project F03, including knowledge of best monitoring practices and intervening factors that may affect monitoring results. Project C27 produced three stand-alone technical reports (Neiswenter 2010a, 2011a, 2016). Until it closed Project D10, in turn, the LCR MSCP typically produced its technical reports and gave its presentations on Project D10 jointly with Project F03 (Dodge 2006, Calvert 2007, 2009, 2010, Kahl 2009, Neiswenter et al. 2009, 2010, Neiswenter 2010b, 2011b, 2013, 2014, Hill 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018a, 2018b, Hill and Calvert 2016, Smith 2017, Hill and Lyon 2019, 2021, Lyon 2020, Hill and Smith 2021).
Through its efforts under Projects C27, D10, and F03, the LCR MSCP has arrived at a stable set of field procedures based on live trapping. The survey team deploy a standard type of trap non-randomly in a surveyed conservation area in a grid in an area of vegetation with the highest likelihood of containing the cotton rat species based on species habitat preferences. This pattern of deployment results in trapping mostly in areas with appropriately dense ground vegetation of the types preferred by the two cotton rat species (LCR MSCP 2016, Johnson and Unnasch 2021). When the survey team encounters distinctly denser vegetation within an otherwise more open area, it places the trapping grid in the denser habitat patch. Trapping is carried out at each conservation areas for a single night in the spring (e.g., early March), late fall (e.g., early November–early December), or both. As summarized most recently by Hill and Smith (2021 pp. 2–3),
“Sherman® live traps are triggered by an animal stepping on a pressure plate that then closes a trap door behind it. Traps were baited with a mixture of oats, peanut butter, and vanilla. A small handful of cotton was also added to each trap to provide insulating cover for any animal trapped overnight. The traps were set 1 to 2 hours before sunset and pulled within 1 to 2 hours of sunrise during the warmer months to minimize heating of the traps during the trapping period. When the habitat patch allowed, traps were set out in a grid of at least three transects approximately 50 feet (15 meters) apart. Each transect consisted of at least five trap stations spaced approximately 33 feet (10 meters) apart. Trap spacing is estimated with pacing and is not measured exactly; it may vary if the more densely vegetated areas are dispersed across the trapping area.
When the habitat patch with the highest density vegetation was more linear, transects were not set in a grid system. If only a single linear stretch of habitat was trapped, a single transect was set along the edge of the habitat patch. This usually meant that the transect was much longer than in the typical grid system (15 or more trap stations).”
Field surveys of small mammals face many challenges, some of which affect their ability to produce accurate, precise estimates of abundance, survival and dispersal rates, and other demographic parameters. However, while these parameters were important to Project C27, they are less important to Project F03. As noted in several annual accomplishment reports (e.g., Hill and Smith 2021 p. 2), Project F03 
“… focuse[s] on determining the presence of the cotton rat species … and the methods [a]re not designed to estimate abundance; therefore, the numbers of individuals of each species (including Colorado River cotton rats and Yuma hispid cotton rats) reported here are rough indices that do not provide reliable means of analyzing population trends.”
Nevertheless, current field procedures in Project F03 do include steps to reduce potential biases in estimates of cotton rat presence due to cotton rat behaviors that may cause them to avoid the traps, as described for example by Brouard et al. (2015) and Romairone et al. (2018). Specifically, as noted by Brouard et al. (2015 p. 2),
“… some [small rodent] species are neophobic and thus exhibit an aversion to new objects within their range, the temporal length of which can vary among species … [and] … olfactory cues in and around a trap can also greatly influence trap entry.”
Olfactory cues specifically affect the likelihood that a small rodent will enter a trap depending on whether the trap bears the scent of a previous occupant that is of the same or a different species. The rodents avoid entering traps with scents of previous occupants of the same species.
Sigmodon hispidus in fact is known to exhibit neophobia and this behavior is affected by social rank: dominant individuals are less neophobic than subordinates (Summerlin and Wolfe 1973). Brouard et al. (2015) note that the effects of neophobia in surveys for small rodents can be reduced by trap “prebaiting,” a procedure in which traps are baited, locked open, and placed at a survey site for a period of days before actual trapping. These steps allow the resident rodents to become familiar with the presence of the equipment. The LCR MSCP has recently incorporated prebaiting into its field procedures for Project F03 and will describe this addition to its methods in a forthcoming technical report for the project.
The effects of previous-occupant scent cues, in turn, can be reduced by washing traps thoroughly between deployments. Project F03 handles this by requiring that every trap be washed in a bleach water solution after it has captured an animal, followed by rinsing in plain water and air drying before redeployment in the next round of field surveillance (e.g., Hill and Smith 2021).
Both prebaiting and post-deployment cleaning of traps add to the effort cost of monitoring for Project F03. Some researchers have reported reduced costs associated with the use of nocturnal camera traps (Garden et al. 2007, De Bondi et al. 2010, Littlewood et al. 2021). However, no information is available to assess whether such alternatives would entail usefully lower costs for Project F03 or produce data that can be compared statistically with live-trapping data. Similarly, monitoring of species presence/absence through environmental DNA (eDNA) (Bohmann et al. 2014) also potentially might reduce the costs of Project F03, but no information is available to assess the possibility.
Cotton rat and pocket mouse activity in the LCR valley likely varies with several environmental factors that affect the likelihood of their encountering a trap during a survey window, as would be the case for any small, nocturnal ground-dwelling mammals. Specifically, excessively cold or hot air temperatures, precipitation, or strong moonlight commonly cause small, nocturnal ground-dwelling mammals to limit their foraging activities (Wolfe and Summerlin 1989, Province of British Columbia 1998, Owen et al. 2021). Weather station data for the LCR valley could be used to evaluate whether any such effects are evident in the monitoring data for Project F03 and from Projects C27 and D10, and the degree to which they may reduce detection rates.
Finally, as noted above, the most definitive way to identify a desert pocket mouse (Chaetodipus penicillatus) as a member of the sobrinus subspecies is through genetic testing. In the absence of such testing, the LCR MSCP presently identifies captured individuals by species but not subspecies (e.g., Hill and Smith 2021). Alternatives would include collecting genetic samples (e.g., blood, hair, feces) from captured individuals or sampling habitat for eDNA. As noted above, the LCR MSCP has not explored the possibility of using eDNA for monitoring in Project F03.

Milestone Description
Cotton rat and pocket mouse activity in the LCR valley likely varies with several environmental factors that affect the likelihood of their encountering a trap during a survey window, as is the case for many small, nocturnal ground-dwelling mammals. Specifically, as noted in the Project Background statement, excessively cold or hot air temperatures, precipitation, or strong moonlight commonly cause small, nocturnal ground-dwelling mammals to limit their foraging. The LCR MSCP can assemble meteorological and lunar phase data for the dates/nights of survey activity under Projects C27, D10, and F03 from weather monitoring stations close to the surveyed locations. Using this dataset, the LCR MSCP can evaluate statistically whether any such effects are evident in the monitoring data for these Projects and estimate the degree to which they may affect detection rates. This information will assist the LCR MSCP in interpreting the survey results. Since the LCR MSCP has not previously carried out such a compilation and analysis, the initial compilation and analysis will mark a milestone for Project F03.

Milestone Name
Assemble and analyze cumulative data on the subspecies identities of the desert pocket mice present in LCR MSCP conservation areas
Milestone Description
One of the three species addressed by Project F03 is the and the sobrinus subspecies of the desert pocket mouse (Chaetodipus penicillatus sobrinus), an LCR MSCP evaluation species. The distribution of this subspecies is thought to be limited to Reaches 1 and 2, while other subspecies occur further south along the LCR valley. Unfortunately, as noted in the Project Background statement, the most definitive way to identify a desert pocket mouse (Chaetodipus penicillatus) as a member of the sobrinus subspecies is through genetic testing. Such testing entails logistical and financial costs, and the LCR MSCP does not routinely include it in its work under Project F03. Consequently, in the absence of such testing, the LCR MSCP presently identifies captured individuals by species but not subspecies. Alternatives would include collecting genetic samples (e.g., blood, hair, feces) from captured individuals or sampling habitat for eDNA; if appropriate, samples could be collected and properly stored for later analysis. At some point, the LCR MSCP will need to plan and conduct such a testing program to guide decisions on the conservation of the subspecies.

Specifically, Implementation Step F03.01.08 calls for the LCR MSCP to acquire data on the meteorological conditions experienced by the fauna at each monitoring location on each monitoring night and the associated phase of the lunar cycle. Once the LCR MSCP has compiled this information for past years of monitoring under Projects C27, D10, and F03, the investigative team will only need to update the dataset for the current year. Meteorological data will be obtained from the nearest weather recording station(s), and may include air temperature (min, max, mean), humidity or wet bulb temperature (min, max, mean), wind speed (min, max, mean), precipitation (total), and cloud cover (min, max, mean). Lunar phase may be expressed simply as phase (percent full), percent of maximum illumination, or other measure of the brightness of the moonlight—one set of data for the entire valley for each monitoring night. The step minimally involves the following five activities: (1) Identify the weather recording stations nearest to the monitoring conservation areas; (2) identify the meteorological data to acquire; (3) acquire the meteorological data for all rodent monitoring dates for all past years of monitoring under Projects C27, D10, and F03 and/or for the current monitoring year; (4) acquire the associated lunar data; (5) organize the data so that it is possible to compare rodent capture presence/absence and frequencies to meteorological conditions and lunar phase; and (5) prepare the metadata file for the cumulative dataset.

Analyze cumulative record from Step F03.01.08 for potential statistical effects of meteorological conditions and lunar phase on variation in species presence/absence and capture frequency within and among conservation areas
Step Summary
Implementation Step F03.01.09, together with Step F03.01.08, allows the LCR MSCP to achieve Milestone F03.01.01. Specifically, Implementation Step F03.01.09 calls for the LCR MSCP to carry out a statistical analysis of the data assembled in Step F03.01.08 to test the null hypothesis that meteorological conditions and lunar phase have no effect on variation in species presence/absence and capture frequencies within and among conservation areas. If initial results indicate that the null hypothesis may be rejected, the analysis will estimate the directions(s) and magnitude(s) of effect(s). The purpose of this second step is to identify monitoring dates when these effects may have significantly distorted monitoring findings—i.e., resulted in higher or lower capture frequencies than would be expected to have occurred in the absence of the effects. The LCR MSCP can then determine if its understanding of variation in CRCR, YHCR, and DPMO captures at conservation sites has been biased by effects of meteorological conditions and lunar phase. The step minimally involves the following five activities: (1) Test for statistical relationships between meteorological variables and capture frequencies for each of the three species; (2) test for statistical relationships between lunar illumination and capture frequencies for each of the three species; (3) for potentially statistically significant relationships (either positive or negative), identify monitoring locations and dates when each such relationship may have resulted in a particularly high or low capture frequency; (4) assess whether LCR MSCP understanding of the presence, frequencies, and spatial distributions of CRCR, YHCR, and DPMO captures would be different if dates were excluded from analysis when meteorological and/or lunar conditions suppressed rodent activity; and (5) prepare metadata files for the resulting analyses.

Step Name
Compare any trialed alternative monitoring methods (if any) to standard monitoring methods for the project based on encounter frequencies, logistical difficulty, and costs
Step Summary
Implementation Step F03.01.10 calls for the LCR MSCP to develop and implement procedures for assessing any alternative monitoring methods the program may test in the field under Project F03. The LCR MSCP will make such assessments through side-by-side comparisons of the encounter frequencies, logistical difficulty, and costs for each trialed method with those documented for the standard monitoring methods for the same monitoring locations and dates. The LCR MSCP does not currently plan to test any alternative methods. Consequently, it is not possible currently to identify the details of Step F03.01.10. However, in general, this step minimally will involve the following four activities: (1) Tabulate the encounter frequencies recorded using each alternative method alongside the frequencies recorded using the standard method for all sites and dates when the two methods were both deployed; (2) using either qualitative or quantitative procedures to compare the logistical difficulty and fiscal costs of the alternative method with those of the standard method for all sites and dates when the two methods were both deployed; (3) summarize the findings in terms of the effectiveness and costs of the alternative method relative to those of the standard method; and (4) prepare a metadata file for the results.
